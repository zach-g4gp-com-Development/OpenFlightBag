# OpenFlightBag
OpenFlightBag is an open-source digital flight companion for pilots. Its core featuresâ€”a map and a flight plannerâ€”are enhanced by a unique app store, allowing you to seamlessly integrate new tools from the community and tailor your perfect flight bag.


# OpenFlightBag - Long Version
OFlB (without the L it can be confused for something else....) is an all-in-one digital flight companion, built by pilots for pilots. Our mission is to create a free and open-source platform that simplifies and enhances every stage of your flight.

At its core, OpenFlightBag replaces the traditional flight bag with a modern, digital solution. The initial release includes a dynamic map for in-flight navigation and situational awareness, and a robust flight planner to help you chart your course. We know that every pilot has a unique workflow, which is why we've designed OpenFlightBag to be completely customizable and extensible.

Our most innovative feature is the integrated App Store. This unique marketplace allows developers and users from the community to contribute new modules and features. Want to add a weather briefing tool? Need a specific weight and balance calculator for your aircraft? The App Store makes it easy to find and install community-developed apps and add-ons to tailor OpenFlightBag to your exact needs.

This modular approach ensures that OpenFlightBag is always evolving and improving. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, we are building a powerful and flexible tool that stays ahead of the curve. Join us and help shape the future of flight planning and navigation.


# Why us?
We are one of the only free flightbags made for the WHOLE world. That's right, made for UK included.
We use data straight from OpenAIP for navaids, airspace boundaries, and more! 


# How to install?
Currently, the way I am operating it is downloading it to a folder and then open the folder in VSCode. This ensures that all the assets are being called. However, working dictionary detection in coming soon...... ðŸ‘€


# How to contribute?
In our development folder is everything we put in there that we were going to use or using. As app uploading is not yet here yet, feel free to open an "issue" to upload your app. A discord server is coming soon to simplify this. We are also accepting suggestions! We are currently aware of the following:

- Weather app
- Charts app
- Way to download waypoints and airports
