## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability, please either email me at webmaster@wdcprp.com or open an issue.
***DO NOT EXPECT PAYMENT***, we are broke ourselves that's why we had to make our own, free, OFlB. 
By reporting a vulnerability, you are helping the community, so we wish that you will report it and not exploit it.

See it, say it, sorted.
